# prioriterize_your_syllabus
It is especially for GTU
In this student has to upload their syllabus
And then my algorithm retrieve all the data from the syllabus and check each chapter contents and weightage
Like it will find which chapter contains less content and more weightage and short all chapters by this and give 
a list with a priority number and chapter number as a response
It will help you to find which chapter you need to learn first while giving exam
